# Flower-Species-Classification-using-Cluster-Analysis

#### This is a simple project I made to better understand the K-Means clustering. Using a public dataset available online, the Iris flower dataset: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set. I tried clustering the data using 2,3 or 4 clusters, based on a satisfactory value of the WCSS(within-cluster sum of squares).
